**Why I made this**
<br>
I built this project because I genuinely miss the old physical photo albums 
our parents used to make.
<br>
Nowadays, our memories are all digital, scattered across clouds, 
lost between screenshots, and buried under thousands of other files. 
<br>I wanted a space where photos felt special again. Not just floating images, 
but a connected ribbon of moments that feels tactile and intentional.
